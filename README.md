Welcome to my JavaScript Project for Flatiron School, in this single page front end project you are able to create movies and add reviews to the movies as well as delete movies and reviews

To install this project, you need to fork and clone this repo, the backend portion, as well as the front end repo located here: https://github.com/kellenmay/movies_client

Once installed run these commands to start the project: bundle install - to install all gems assocaited with this project, rails db:migrate - to add the migrations to your database and updating schema, rails s - to boot up the server.

From the front end we will want to open INDEX.HTML in the browser using this command, explorer.exe index.html. This will open up the webpage for our front-end user experience!
